# Day 3: Context and Memory

## The Context Challenge
LLMs are stateless. Agents need to remember.

## Memory Types
1.  **Short-term**: Current context window.
2.  **Long-term**: Vector DBs for retrieving past knowledge.
3.  **Episodic**: Remembering specific past interactions to personalize experience.
